To use NVS simply specify `--neural-vocab-selection --bow-task-pos-weight 100000` to `sockeye-train`.
This will train a model with Neural Vocabulary Selection that is automatically used by `sockeye-translate`.
If you want look at translations without vocabulary selection specify `--skip-nvs` as an argument to `sockeye-translate`.
For the NVS model see `sockeye/nvs.py`.
